This is the repository for the LeafLabs Maple Native design. This design was created in KiCad. In order to properly view the schematics, and to make any changes to the design, you must add the leaf hardware and schematics libraries, available at http://github.com/leaflabs/hardware-lib. Once you have places the libraries in a directory of your choosing, add them as follows:

1. In EESchema (the schematic editor), click Preferences -> Libs and Dir. Click Add, browse to the location of leaf.lib, open it, and click Safe Cfg. Save your project and close.
2. In CVpcb (components to modules), click Preferences -> Configuration. Click the Add button above the libraries window, and browse to the location of leaf.mod. Save the config and close.
3. In PCBnew (PCB editor), click Preferences -> Libs and Dir. Add leaf.mod, save config, and close.
